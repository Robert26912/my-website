    "about": "I am a recently graduated IoT engineer who enjoys communication and actively engaging in problem-solving. Creativity, passion, analytical and observational skills constitute my superpowers. Apathy and lack of interest from the team towards a task are my weaknesses. Following a fulfilling one-year work experience at Genelec, I am now prepared to join a new team and embark on learning fresh insights and skills. Let's do something great together.",
